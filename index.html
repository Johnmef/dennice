                  <div class="topic-para">I will fight for no new taxes or charges and endorse sensible
                    financial control. The cost of living is ever increasing – rate payers
                    should not be burdened with further unnecessary increases to our
                    rates. In particular: I will NOT support the proposed Council tax on
                    new dwellings and developments (currently at a minimum of 3%) but
                    rather encourage initiatives such as the Women’s Community Shelter -
                    Dianella House on the Mornington Peninsula. In addition, we need to
                    build upon a stronger infrastructure that means dwelling approvals
                    occur in a sensible, timely manner and allow tiny house builds. Also,
                    I will NOT support future plans to introduce the foreshore paid
                    parking experiment.</div>

                  <div class="topic-heading">Back to the Basics – Roads and transport</div>
                  <div class="topic-para">  Too many roads are dangerous and in disrepair. For example, sections
                    of Coolart Road, Myers Road, Bittern-Dromana Road, Balnarring Road,
                    Stanleys Road, Frankston-Flinders Road and Hendersons Road to name
                    just a few. I believe in prioritizing the fundamental needs of our
                    community, starting with our roads. I will not accept the excuse that
                    we cannot lobby for better State roads especially where there is a
                    cross over between Shire and State roads. I commit to advocating on
                    your behalf to our state and federal MPs for improved road
                    infrastructure. This also includes a clear plan for weekend
                    transportation between Flinders and the Mornington Peninsula. I will
                    regularly report back to you on the progress of these efforts.

                    have female changerooms and I will speak on your behalf to ensure the
                    facilities are equitable for usage. We need more than just temporary
